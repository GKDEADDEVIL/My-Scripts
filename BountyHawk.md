**Title of the Project:**
"BountyHawk: Automated Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Discovery Framework"

**Introduction:**
In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity has become paramount, with organizations facing increasingly sophisticated threats to their digital assets. Bug Bounty programs have emerged as a popular approach for organizations to leverage the collective expertise of security researchers and testers to identify vulnerabilities in their systems before malicious actors exploit them. However, conducting effective Bug Bounty hunting requires comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery processes, which can be time-consuming and complex.

To address these challenges, we introduce BountyHawk, an automated framework designed to streamline the reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery phases of Bug Bounty hunting. BountyHawk empowers testers and developers with a comprehensive set of tools and automation capabilities, enabling them to efficiently identify and mitigate security risks in web-based and cloud-based systems.

**Abstract:**
BountyHawk is a sophisticated framework developed to facilitate Bug Bounty hunting and application security testing. Leveraging automation and a modular design, BountyHawk empowers testers and developers to conduct thorough security assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and enhance the overall security posture of digital ecosystems.

The framework encompasses a range of features and functionalities, including subdomain enumeration, link and JavaScript discovery, subdomain bruteforcing, server and port enumeration, and final analysis. By integrating various tools and techniques, BountyHawk enables users to conduct comprehensive reconnaissance, map target infrastructures, and uncover potential attack vectors.

BountyHawk is designed for local usage, allowing testers and developers to run the framework on localhost and store data in a local MongoDB database. This ensures data privacy and security while providing users with full control over their testing environments. Additionally, BountyHawk is accompanied by detailed documentation and support resources to assist users in getting started and maximizing the benefits of the framework.

**4. Existing and Proposed System:**

**Existing System:**
Traditionally, Bug Bounty hunting and application security testing have relied on manual reconnaissance processes and a fragmented set of tools for vulnerability discovery. Testers and developers often face challenges in navigating and integrating multiple tools effectively, leading to inefficiencies and gaps in coverage. Additionally, the existing system may lack centralized data management capabilities, making it difficult to store and analyze scan results efficiently.

**Proposed System:**
BountyHawk aims to address the limitations of the existing system by introducing an automated framework for reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery. The proposed system offers a comprehensive set of tools and automation capabilities, streamlining the Bug Bounty hunting process and enhancing the effectiveness of security assessments. By providing a modular and user-friendly interface, BountyHawk enables testers and developers to conduct thorough security assessments with ease.

**5. Advantages of Proposed System:**

1. **Automation:** BountyHawk automates manual reconnaissance processes, saving time and effort for testers and developers.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The framework integrates multiple tools and techniques for comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery.
3. **User-Friendly Interface:** BountyHawk features a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to testers and developers with varying levels of expertise.
4. **Centralized Data Management:** The proposed system allows for centralized storage and management of scan results, facilitating efficient data analysis and reporting.
5. **Modularity:** BountyHawk's modular design enables users to customize and extend the framework according to their specific requirements.

**6. Module Description:**

BountyHawk comprises several modules, each serving a specific purpose in the reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery process:

1. **Subdomain Enumeration:** This module is responsible for enumerating subdomains using tools like Sublist 3 r, Amass, and Assetfinder.
2. **Link / JS Discovery:** It discovers links and JavaScript files associated with the target domain using tools such as GoSpider, Hakrawler, and SubDomainizer.
3. **Subdomain Bruteforcing:** This module performs subdomain bruteforcing using tools like ShuffleDNS with custom wordlists.
4. **Server/Port Enumeration:** It enumerates servers and ports associated with the target domain using tools like Cloud Ranges and Dnmasscan.
5. **Final Analysis:** This module conducts a final analysis, builds a list of unique subdomains, checks subdomain status using Httpprobe, and generates reports using tools like EyeWitness.

Each module plays a crucial role in the reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery process, contributing to the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the BountyHawk framework.
